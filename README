======================================================================

This little repository is supposed to store and manage the code that
I create when experimenting with the Arduino platform and try to
figure out how to make certain things happen.
I chose Github because I not only want my files to be safe from data
loss but also safe from my overly nervous CTRL+S reflexes ;-)

If you happen to stumble upon this: Enjoy! But beware, these things
might not always work.
